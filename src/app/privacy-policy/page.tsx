        <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
        <p>
          At Oncode, the privacy and security of our customers, developers, and visitors are of paramount importance. Oncode is committed to protecting the data you share with us. This privacy policy explains how Oncode processes information that can be used to directly or indirectly identify an individual (“Personal Data”) collected through use of its website and platform. For the purposes of this policy, Oncode defines the term “Applicant” as any individual who applies to work with Oncode as a customer or developer, and the term “Visitor” as an individual that visits our front-end website (for example, https://oncode.in/).
        </p>
        <p>
          Any information stored on Oncode’s platform is treated as confidential. All information is stored securely and is accessed by authorized personnel only. Oncode implements and maintains appropriate technical, security, and organizational measures to protect Personal Data against unauthorized or unlawful processing and use, and against accidental loss, destruction, damage, theft, or disclosure.

        <h3>2.2 Website Visitors</h3>
        <p>
          If you are a Visitor to our website only, and not an Applicant of our platform, then this section is relevant for you. By visiting this website, you consent to the collection and use of your Personal Data as described herein. If you do not agree with the terms set out herein, please do not visit this website. If required by applicable law, we will seek your explicit consent to process Personal Data collected on this website or volunteered by you. Kindly note that any consent will be entirely voluntary.
        </p>
        <p>
          However, if you do not grant the requested consent to the processing of your Personal Data, the use of this website may not be possible. Oncode may collect, record, and analyze information of Visitors to its website. We may record your IP address and use cookies. Oncode may add information collected by way of pageview activity. Furthermore, Oncode may collect and process any Personal Data that you volunteer to us in our website’s forms, such as when you register for events or sign up for information and newsletters. If you provide Oncode with your social media details, Oncode may retrieve publicly available information about you from social media.
        </p>
        <p>
          Such Personal Data may comprise your IP address, first and last name, your postal and email address, your telephone number, your job title, data for social networks, your areas of interest, interest in Oncode products, and certain information about the company you are working for (company name and address), as well as information as to the type of relationship that exists between Oncode and yourself. Oncode gathers data about visits to the website, including numbers of Visitors and visits, Geo-location data, length of time spent on the site, pages clicked on, or where Visitors have come.
        </p>

        <h3>2.2.1 Purpose of Processing Personal Data</h3>
        <p>
          Oncode uses the collected data to communicate with Visitors, to customize content for Visitors, to show ads on other websites to Visitors, and to improve its website by analyzing how Visitors navigate its website.
        </p>

        <h3>2.2.2 Sharing Personal Data</h3>
        <p>
          Oncode may also share such information with service vendors or contractors in order to provide a requested service or transaction or in order to analyze the Visitor behavior on its website.
        </p>

        <h3>2.2.3 Cookies</h3>
        <p>
          Cookies are small pieces of information sent by a website to a Visitor’s hard disk. Cookies cannot be used to run programs or deliver viruses to your computer. By continuing to visit the website, you agree to the placement of cookies on your device. If you choose not to accept our cookies, we cannot guarantee that your experience will be as fulfilling as it would otherwise be. We may also place cookies from third parties for functional and marketing purposes. The use of cookies is widespread and benefits the surfer.

        <h3>2.2.3.1 Type of Cookies We Use</h3>
        <h4>Analytics and Performance Cookies</h4>
        <p>
          These cookies are used to collect information about traffic to Oncode and how users use Oncode. The information gathered does not identify any individual visitor. The information is aggregated and therefore anonymous. It includes the number of visitors to Oncode, the websites that referred them to Oncode, the pages that they visited on Oncode, what time of day they visited Oncode, whether they have visited Oncode before, and other similar information. We use this information to help operate Oncode more efficiently, to gather broad demographic information, and to monitor the level of activity on Oncode. We use Google Analytics for this purpose. Google Analytics uses its own cookies. It is only used to improve how Oncode works.
        </p>

        <h4>Essential Cookies</h4>
        <p>
          These cookies are essential to provide you with services available through Oncode and to enable you to use some of its features. For example, they allow you to log in to secure areas of Oncode and help the content of the pages you request load quickly. Without these cookies, the services that you have asked for cannot be provided, and we only use these cookies to provide you with those services.
        </p>

        <h4>Social Media Cookies</h4>
        <p>
          These cookies are used when you share information using a social media sharing button or “like” button on Oncode or you link your account or engage with our content on or through a social networking website such as Facebook, Twitter, or Google+. The social network will record that you have done this.
        </p>

        <h4>Targeted and Advertising Cookies</h4>
        <p>
          These cookies track your browsing habits to enable us to show advertising that is more likely to be of interest to you. These cookies use information about your browsing history to group you with other users who have similar interests. Based on that information, and with our permission, third-party advertisers can place cookies to enable them to show adverts that we think will be relevant to your interests while you are on third-party websites. These cookies may also store your location, including your latitude, longitude, and GeoIP region ID, which helps us show you locale-specific news and allows Oncode to operate more efficiently.
        </p>
        <p>
          You can disable cookies that remember your browsing habits and target advertising at you by visiting <a href="http://www.youronlinechoices.com/uk/your-ad-choices" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">youronlinechoices.com</a>. If you choose to remove targeted or advertising cookies, you will still see adverts, but they may not be relevant to you. Even if you do choose to remove cookies by the companies listed at the above link, not all companies that serve online behavioral advertising are included in this list, and so you may still receive some cookies and tailored adverts from companies that are not listed.
