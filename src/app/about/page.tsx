            <p>
                Hey there! Welcome to Oncode! üéâ We‚Äôre not just another tech company; we‚Äôre a bunch of coding enthusiasts on a mission to help startups in India shine online. Our adventure started over countless cups of coffee and slices of pizza üçï, where two friends couldn‚Äôt stop chatting about the magic of coding. Fast forward to today, and here we are, building awesome websites and apps while having a blast!

                We‚Äôve faced our fair share of challenges (who hasn‚Äôt in tech?), but we tackled them head-on, fueled by our passion for innovation and, of course, our love for snacks. Every project we take on is like a new adventure, and we love working closely with our clients to bring their ideas to life. Together, we‚Äôre creating something special!
